# Level of German gas storage facilities

# Introduction
Winter is just around the corner in Germany, and people are worried about gas storage due to the current situation. The gas storage facilities serve as a buffer for the gas market and are intended to compensate for fluctuations in gas consumption. At the beginning of the heating period in the fall, they are usually well filled. On particularly cold days in winter, up to 60 percent of gas consumption is covered by the storage facilities. I have evaluated and visualized the data of the gas storage levels since 2016 so that one can quickly get an up-to-date picture of the situation.

# Process
For data cleaning and analysis, I used RStudio, an integrated development environment for R. The exact procedure can be viewed [here](https://github.com/dfirat/germany-gas-storage/blob/main/germany-gas-storage.md).
I used Tableau to visualize the results, which can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dfirat/viz/LevelofGermangasstoragefacilities/Dashboard1).

# Results
Germany is aiming to have 95 percent of its storage facilities filled by the beginning of November. This volume of gas is roughly equivalent to consumption in the first two months of 2022. Although gas supplies from Russia declined significantly, the interim targets of 75 percent and 85 percent were reached ahead of schedule on August 12 and September 2, respectively. It should also be emphasized that they are being filled even faster than the 2013-2021 average.
