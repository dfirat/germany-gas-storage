# Level of German gas storage facilities

# Introduction
Winter is just around the corner in Germany, and people are worried about gas storage due to the current situation. The gas storage facilities serve as a buffer for the gas market and are intended to compensate for fluctuations in gas consumption. At the beginning of the heating period in the fall, they are usually well filled. On particularly cold days in winter, up to 60 percent of gas consumption is covered by the storage facilities. I have evaluated and visualized the data of the gas storage levels since 2016 so that one can quickly get an up-to-date picture of the situation.

# Process
For data cleaning and analysis, I used RStudio, an integrated development environment for R. The exact procedure can be viewed [here](https://github.com/dfirat/germany-gas-storage/blob/main/germany-gas-storage.md).
I used Tableau to visualize the results, which can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dfirat/viz/LevelofGermangasstoragefacilities/Dashboard1).

# Results
Germany aims to fill its storage facilities to 95 percent by November 1. This volume of gas is roughly equivalent to consumption in the first two months of 2022. Although gas supplies from Russia have fallen significantly, the interim targets of 75 percent (September 1) and 85 percent (October 1) were already met ahead of schedule on August 12 and September 2, respectively. It is also worth highlighting that they are being met even faster than the 2013-2021 average.
